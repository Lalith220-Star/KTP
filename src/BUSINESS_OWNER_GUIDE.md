# Localytics Business Owner Quick Start Guide

## Welcome to Your Operational Intelligence Dashboard

Congratulations on taking the first step toward data-driven restaurant management! This guide will help you maximize the value of your Localytics dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

When you first log in, you'll see your **LBH (Local Business Health) Score** - a proprietary 0-100 metric that measures your restaurant's overall operational health based on public data analysis.

### What Makes LBH Score Different?

Unlike simple star ratings, your LBH Score:
- ✅ Aggregates data from multiple sources (reviews, job postings, hours changes)
- ✅ Compares you against local competitors in your cuisine category
- ✅ Identifies root causes, not just symptoms
- ✅ Provides weighted scoring (factors that matter more count more)
- ✅ Tracks trends over time to measure improvement

## 6 Core Tabs - What Each Does

### 1. 🔥 **Operational Insights** (START HERE)
**Purpose:** Find and fix critical issues FAST

**What You'll See:**
- **Public Data Signals:** Real-time monitoring from reviews, job posts, operating hours
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Exactly WHY your score dropped (e.g., "3 server positions posted = high turnover = service score drop")
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Priority-ranked fixes with estimated impact

**When to Use:**
- Weekly check-in to catch new issues
- After a score drop
- Before making operational changes

**Example Insight:**
```
🔴 CRITICAL: Food Quality (72/100) - 8 points below local Italian average

Root Cause:
Recent reviews mention inconsistent seasoning. Analysis shows 3 new kitchen staff 
job postings in last 60 days, indicating turnover.

Recommendation:
Conduct immediate kitchen staff training on portion control and recipe 
standardization. Implement daily taste tests before service.

Expected Impact: +8-12 points in 30-45 days
Timeframe: Implement within 7 days

## Understanding Your LBH Score Components

Your score is calculated from 6 weighted factors:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Food Quality** | 30% | Taste, freshness, presentation, consistency |
| **Service** | 25% | Staff friendliness, speed, attentiveness |
| **Ambiance** | 15% | Atmosphere, decor, comfort, noise level |
| **Value for Money** | 15% | Pricing vs. quality and portion sizes |
| **Cleanliness** | 10% | Hygiene, maintenance, presentation |
| **Location** | 5% | Accessibility, parking, convenience |

**Why These Weights?**
- Food Quality and Service have the highest impact on customer satisfaction and repeat business
- Ambiance and Value significantly influence decision-making
- Cleanliness and Location are important but typically less variable
